      <p>Watch Dogs is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. Players complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. Outside of missions, players can freely roam the open world of Chicago. The world may be fully explored from the beginning of the game without restrictions, although story progress unlocks more gameplay content.

        <p>In Salem, Massachusetts, Detective Ronan O'Connor is thrown out of a window while pursuing the brutal and relentless serial-killer, the Bell Killer, who finishes Ronan off by shooting him. Revived as a ghost, Ronan meets the spirit of his long-dead wife Julia, who informs him that he can not join her until he completes the unfinished business binding him to the living world. Ronan investigates his murder, and gains instruction into his new ghostly abilities from the ghost of Abigail, a young Puritan-era girl. The investigation leads to a local church to find a young girl, Joy, who witnessed Ronan's murder, and possesses the ability to see ghosts.</p>

       <p>Skyrim's main story revolves around the player character's efforts to defeat Alduin, a Dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. Set two hundred years after Oblivion, the game takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops their character by improving their skills. Unlike previous Elder Scrolls games, Skyrim does not require the player to select a character class at the beginning of the game, negating a problem the development team felt previous entries had by forcing the player into a rigid play-style too early in the game. Skyrim continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.</p>

        <p>Red Dead Redemption is an open world game. As protagonist John Marston, players can interact with the environment and engage in combat with enemies, using various firearms. Different breeds of horses are the main forms of transportation, each with different attributes. These horses must be tamed in order to use them. Marston can utilize trains to get from place to place quickly, but he can also stop the train by threatening or killing the passengers or driver.

       <p>The game begins in the year 2017 with U.S. Army Captain Elias Walker (Stephen Lang) telling his two sons, Logan and David "Hesh" Walker (Brandon Routh) the legend of how the Ghosts, an elite coalition of all US Special Operations units, first appeared. Meanwhile in space, Federation soldiers hijack the controlling space station of the Orbital Defense Initiative (ODIN),[8] an orbital superweapon that utilizes kinetic bombardment, and use it to destroy several cities in the southwestern United States. The surviving American astronauts, Baker and Mosley, sacrifice themselves to self-destruct the space station and prevent the other ODIN satellites from launching their payloads further inland. Elias and the teenage Logan and David narrowly escape the destruction of San Diego.</p>
