YAKL stands for Yet Another Kid Locator. 
This application is used to locate your kids. You can send an SMS message to your child's phone and receive his location in a reply SMS. 
The SMS you send should contain a keyword that will be identified by the application to trigger the location. The SMS keyword can be set using the settings tab of the application. 
The YAKL application will try to get a fix on the receiving phone's location using either the GPS provider or the NETWORK provider and send back an SMS containing the coordinates of the phone's location and a Google Maps URL for the location. 
You can also configure the the phone to ring for a specified duration when receiving the location SMS message.
